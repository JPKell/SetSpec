"""setspec.prompts — the prompt library: records, packs, rendering and hashing.

Prompts are versioned data, not source code
([ADR-0012](../../docs/adr/0012-prompt-storage-format.md),
[Prompt Management Standards](../../docs/standards/prompt-management-standards.md)). This module
is the loader, validator, renderer and hasher for **any** application's prompt pack: it holds no
prompt of its own and knows nothing about benchmarks, applications or any particular directory
layout — every path is an argument, never a default. Extracted from FreeWeight's
``freeweight.services.prompts`` at LoadCoach Phase 4 / SetSpec Phase 5
([ADR-0011](../../docs/adr/0011-shared-package-boundaries.md),
[ADR-0028](../../docs/adr/0028-prompt-pack-granularity.md)) — FreeWeight, LoadCoach and IdeaPress
each keep their own pack directory and their own thin default-path wrapper around
:func:`load_pack`, exactly as they each keep their own database schema on top of ``weightsdb``.

**Two hashes, and only one of them is a fingerprint input.**

* ``sha256`` over a record's canonical JSON identifies one prompt version.
* :func:`prompt_subset_hash` over the sorted ``(prompt_id, version, sha256)`` of *the prompts one
  benchmark declares* is what enters a reproducibility fingerprint and evidence-separation rules.
  Editing a prompt no benchmark uses changes no fingerprint (ADR-0028 §1).
* :func:`pack_hash` is the same computation over the whole pack. It is recorded as **provenance
  only** — "which pack was installed" — and is never hashed into a fingerprint.

Both cross an application boundary inside ``capability.evidence``, so their determinism is a
contract and is golden-tested (ADR-0028 §3), not merely exercised.

Rendering is Jinja2 with ``StrictUndefined`` and no filesystem or network access in the
environment: a referenced-but-unsupplied variable is an error, never an empty string. Unknown
variables supplied by a caller are an error too — that is how a renamed variable is caught rather
than silently ignored.

Loading and validation are meant to happen **once at startup** in every consumer; a malformed
prompt is a startup failure, never a surprise in the middle of a run.
